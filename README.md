## How to run?

Because I wrote this using `processing-py` to run this you will have some challenges (sorry!).

1. First things first, you need to install Processing on your local machine, follow the instructions [here](https://processing.org/download/)
2. Now, in order to run this from the command line, follow [this instructions](https://py.processing.org/tutorials/command-line)
3. Finally, to run the program:

```bash
# You need to point the location where the processing-py is stored on your local machine
java -jar /path/to/jar/processing-py.jar processing.py
```
